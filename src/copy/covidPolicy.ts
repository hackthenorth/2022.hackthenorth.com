## Introduction

Our team is excited for the return of in-person hacking, and we hope you are too! We’re working hard to plan a safe Hack the North. Although we’re doing our best to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at our event, it is difficult to predict what the COVID-19 situation will be during the hacking weekend. This page is intended to outline the minimum precautions that will be in place at Hack the North and provide an idea of what additional precautions may look like.

## Minimum safety protocols

All attendees at Hack the North are required to provide proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 before entering the event. Additionally, the following safety precautions will be enforced to ensure the safety of all our attendees:
1. Attendees will complete a health screening questionnaire and have their temperature checked upon arrival at Hack the North.
2. Masks, hand sanitizing stations, and disinfectant wipes will be provided throughout the event.

We understand that there’s no one-size-fits-all when it comes to COVID-19 safety measures. If you require additional accommodations, such as eating in an open space or private sleeping quarters, please reach out to [hello@hackthenorth.com](mailto:hello@hackthenorth.com). 

## Possible additional safety protocols

Depending on the state of the COVID-19 pandemic in September, we may require our attendees to follow additional measures, such as:
- Attendees will be required to wear a mask at all times, except for when eating, sleeping in the designated sleeping rooms, or within washrooms.
- Attendees will be required to submit a negative COVID-19 antigen test taken within 48 hours of the start of the event.
