              Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
              <br />
              <br />
              Thanks for checking out the Hack the North 2023 organizer
              applications. This September, we&rsquo;ll be hosting our 10th
              iteration of Hack the North, in-person and better than ever! ðŸŽ‰
              <br />
              <br />
              These roles are open to any student attending a post-secondary
              institution in Waterloo, and will be located in Waterloo during
              either the Winter (January - April) or Spring (May - August) terms
              this year. Your program, age, gender, or other personal factors
              will not be factored in during hiring decisions.
              <br />
              <br />
              All organizers are required to attend weekly All-Hands meetings
              and regular weekly/bi-weekly team-specific meetings. The average
              time commitment for team members is 7-10 hours per week, however,
              the exact time commitment may vary week-to-week depending on the
              role. Feel free to apply to as many roles as you&rsquo;re
              interested in, but please note that each hired organizer can only
              take on one role.
              <br />
              <br />
              Don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t meet all the role
              requirements! We&rsquo;re looking for people who are eager to
              learn and have a strong desire to contribute to the team.
              <br />
